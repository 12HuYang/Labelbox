# Labelbox
[Labelbox](https://www.labelbox.com/) is a data labeling tool that's purpose
built for machine learning applications. Start labeling data in minutes using
pre-made labeling interfaces, or create your own pluggable interface to suit
the needs of your data labeling task. Labelbox is lightweight for single users
or small teams and scales up to support large teams and massive data sets.

## Benefits
- **Simple image labeling**: Labelbox makes it quick and easy to do basic image
  classification or segmentation tasks. To get started, simply upload your data
  or a CSV file containing URLs pointing to your data hosted on a server,
  select a labeling interface, (optional) invite collaborators and start labeling.

- **Label just about anything**: Create a custom labeling interface to meet the
  needs of your labeling task. Start by customizing one of the standard
  Labelbox interfaces or build one from the ground up, just import
  `labeling-api.js` in a script tag. See 
  [Creating Custom Labeling Interfaces](#creating-custom-labeling-interfaces)
  to get started.

- **Manage Teams**: Invite your team members to help with labeling tasks. Labelbox
  streamlines your labeling workflows, from micro labeling projects for quick
  R&D to production grade projects requiring hundreds of collaborators.

- **Measure Performance**: Maintain the highest quality standards for your data by
  keeping track of labeling task performance of individuals and teams.
